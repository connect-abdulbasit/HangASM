# 🎮 Hangman - COAL Project

This is a simple **Hangman game** created using **Assembly Language (x86)** as part of our **Computer Organization and Assembly Language (COAL)** course.

The game runs in the console and allows the player to guess letters of a hidden word, with limited attempts – just like the classic Hangman!

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Assembly Language (x86)**  
- **Microsoft Macro Assembler (MASM)**  
- **Visual Studio 2019** (for writing, assembling, linking, and running the program)

## 🎯 Project Objective

To gain practical experience with Assembly language by implementing a playable console game that demonstrates logic, control flow, and user interaction at the low level.
