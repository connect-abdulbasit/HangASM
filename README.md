# 🎮 HangASM — Assembly Language Hangman Game

**HangASM** is a simple **Hangman-style game** developed using **x86 Assembly Language**, created as part of our **Computer Organization and Assembly Language (COAL)** course.

The game runs in the console and challenges the player to guess letters of a hidden word with a limited number of attempts — just like the classic Hangman!
